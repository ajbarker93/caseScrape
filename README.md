# ECHR documents
The idea of this small project is to examine documents from HUDOC, the official search engine for ECHR-released documents. These documents contain judgements and other legal texts from the European Court of Human Rights. Potential use cases include automatic filtering by topic, searching for trends in how judgements are made, and similar use cases.
